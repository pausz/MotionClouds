In particular, these stimuli can be made closer to naturalistic textures compared to usual stimuli such as gratings and random-dot kinetograms. We simplified the definition to parametrically define these \"Motion Clouds\" around the most prevalent feature axis (mean and bandwith): direction, spatial frequency, orientation.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://invibe.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi/SciBlog/2011-07-12?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=MotionPlaid_comp1.gif\" width=\"100%\">\r\n\r\nThis work is supported by the European Union project Number FP7-269921, ``BrainScaleS'' (Brain-inspired multiscale computation in neuromorphic hybrid systems), an EU FET-Proactive FP7 funded research project.

It is meant to be an open-source package  that can be combined with other packages such as PsychoPy or VisionEgg.\r\n\r\nAll functions are implemented in one main script called `MotionClouds.py` that handles the Fourier cube, the envelope functions as well as the random phase generation and all Fourier related processing. Additionally, all the auxiliary visualization tools to plot the spectra and the movies are included. Specific scripts such as `test_color.py`, `test_speed.py`, `test_radial.py` and `test_orientation.py` explore the role of different parameters for each individual envelope (respectively color, speed, radial frequency, orientation). Our aim is to keep the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and flexible. To sum up, when we build a custom  Motion Cloud there are 3 simple steps to follow:\r\n\r\n1. set the MC parameters and construct the Fourier envelope, then visualize it as iso-surfaces: \r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport MotionClouds as mc\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n# define Fourier domain\r\nfx, fy, ft = mc.get_grids(mc.N_X, mc.N_Y, mc.N_frame) \r\n# define an envelope\r\nenvelope = mc.envelope_gabor(fx, fy, ft, \r\n    V_X=1., V_Y=0., B_V=.1, \r\n    sf_0=.15, B_sf=.1, \r\n    theta=0., B_theta=np.pi/8, alpha=1.) \r\n# Visualize the Fourier Spectrum\r\nmc.visualize(envelope)  \r\n```\r\n2. perform the IFFT and contrast normalization; visualize the stimulus as a 'cube' visualization of the image sequence, \r\n\r\n```python\r\nmovie = mc.random_cloud(envelope)\r\nmovie = mc.rectif(movie)\r\n# Visualize the Stimulus\r\nmc.cube(movie, name=name + '_cube') \r\n```\r\n3. export the stimulus as a movie (.mpeg format available), as separate frames (.bmp and .png formats available) in a compressed zipped folder, or as a Matlab matrix (.mat format). \r\n\r\n```python\r\nmc.anim_save(movie, name, display=False, vext='.mpeg')\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf some parameters are not given, they are set to default values corresponding to a ''standard'' Motion Cloud. Moreover, the user can easily explore a range of different Motion Clouds simply by setting  an array of values for a determined parameter. Here, for example, we generate 8 MCs with increasing spatial frequency `sf_0` while keeping the other parameters fixed to default values:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfor sf_0 in [0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6]:\r\n    name_ = 'figures/' + name + '-sf_0-' + str(sf_0).replace('.', '_')\r\n    # function performing plots for a given set of parameters\r\n    mc.figures_MC(fx, fy, ft, name_, sf_0=sf_0) \r\n```\r\n\r\n```","google":"","tagline":"Model-based stimulus synthesis of natural-like random textures for the study of motion perception","note":"Don't delete this file!
